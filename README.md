# StripHitEfficiency
Tools for shifters and experts for producing hit efficiency results.

## ShifterTools

Directory with the tools for the hit efficiency monitoring to be used by tracker shift leaders.
Comparisons of the measured efficiencies are made with the predicted efficiencies based on the model code from the **PredictionsModel** directory.

## ExpertTools

Code for producing hit efficiency results of a full LHC fill (several runs).

### Installation

The location where to store the files accessible on the web repository has to be updated in 3 files: HitEffDriver.sh, TrendPlots.sh and python/settings.py (respectively for run plots, trend plots and predictions).
