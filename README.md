# StripHitEfficiency
Tools for shifters and experts for producing hit efficiency results.

## ShifterTools

Directory with the tools for the hit efficiency monitoring to be used by tracker shift leaders.
Comparisons of the measured efficiencies are made with the predicted efficiencies based on the model code from the **PredictionsModel** directory.

## ExpertTools

Code for producing hit efficiency results of a full LHC fill (several runs).
