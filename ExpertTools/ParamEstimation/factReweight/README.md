# factReweight

`ComputeFillWeight.py` computes the fill weight based on the filling scheme described in `fill.json` and the deadtimes stored in `Ndeadtime.txt`. 

The output is saved in `factReweight.txt`. It is necessary in the prediction model to reweight the deadtimes that have been derived from a particular fill.
